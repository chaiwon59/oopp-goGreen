# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Database connection was not entirely correct

Had to redo the database connection which took some extra time, also the research we needed to do on the database part took some more time than planned.
Connection is now working fine


## Adjustments for next sprints

 I guess try to plan the tasks more realistically so you include the required research time
