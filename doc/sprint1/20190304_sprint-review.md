# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Database connection tests do not show any coverage

We worked on the database connection and tried testing it,
 but it does pass the tests but does not show coverage of the code for the connection. 


## Adjustments for next sprints

 - From this week on the person chairing has the responsibility to make sure that everyone has finished their work as indicated on the sprint backlog 
 and the sprint review is done before the meeting.
