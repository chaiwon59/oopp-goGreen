# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Issues with mockito

The database connection class was tested using mockito. However, when trying to test the RegisterUserController class using mockito, we encountered a few problems where the tests were either failing or passing without any coverage. Hence we reverted back to JUnit tests for the demo.

## Adjustments for next sprints
