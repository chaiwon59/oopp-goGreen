This meeting we are working on the scrumboard. 
We added the issues we already closed this week and the week before. 
Also we changed the library we are using again to Spring since this seems 
like an easier alternative. This meeting we will be implementing the client-side and the server-side 
so it can send communicate. 
We decided to use Spring for setting up the server and HttpClientApache for the client-side.
