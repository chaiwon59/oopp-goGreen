# Group Rules

- In case of coming late the person has to bring some food to the next meeting. If somebody is around 5 minutes late it doesn’t really matter.
- When somebody did not finish their work for that certain week without a valid reason, make sure that person finishes the work asap. Falling behind hinders the entire team.
- So it is okay if you do some research and go a little bit ahead but make sure you don’t get ahead too much with your part of the project so the rest of the group does not fall behind.
- During the meetings explain what you coded to the other members so in the end everybody understands the project and not just their own part.
- The leader of the weeks uploads the agenda a day before the meeting and everyone reads the agenda before the meeting
- The Secretary of the week writes the notes in or at the bottom of the agenda, so everyone who didn't attend can easily find it
- When someone is unable to attend they should update the group about what they've done before the meeting
- If you can't attend the meeting, post it on Mattermost to also notify the TA
