# Meeting notes 11-03-2019

Before you work on a task make sure nobody else is working on it. If it’s going to be a similar subject make
sure you don’t do the same stuff and combine everything. Communicate more often.

Make sure the sprints are well ordered and well named (every sprint has multiple files combined with them).

Make sure for the demo testing is at least 80% because otherwise it is going to be way too much work for in
the end. And testing can be done in separate tasks.

Make sure everything is finished and merged by the end of this week.

There are loads of functions, make sure everything is working together and merged asap, and work further from
that point on.
